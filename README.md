## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

this project helped me with the review of css grids and styling, it also helped with semantic html coding, and helped with reviewing how to code responsively


### Continued development

I really struggled with the active state (hovering over the image) I left the project to clear my mind, also I'm not rushing so I did slack a little lol, but eventually I figured it out, though I did not manage to get it to work in responsive state, so I did not implement it in the responsive state, it's not necessary because with smartphones and tablets you don't have a pointer to hover over the image, still though I will try to implement it in future updates...


### Useful resources

- [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com) - Helped reviewing css grid and transitions
